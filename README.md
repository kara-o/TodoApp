# ToDo App

I started out following the [Redux basic tutorial](https://redux.js.org/basics/basic-tutorial/), using React-Redux, and expanded it to have [Node/Express RESTful API backend](https://github.com/kara-o/todoapp_backend), incorporating asynchronous actions/flow with [ReduxThunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk).

Currently still building it out, so keep checking back :)
